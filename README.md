# Application Overview

This application is a React-based web project that utilizes RxJS for reactive state management. It introduces an architectural concept where both the frontend UI and server interactions are abstracted through ViewModels, facilitating a consistent and modular approach to managing interactions across different "peripheries" of the application.

## How does it work?

### Reactive Data Flow

The application leverages RxJS observables and subjects to create a reactive data flow, ensuring that updates in the application state are propagated in real-time. This allows UI components to automatically update in response to state changes, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.

### ViewModels for UI and Server Interactions

The application employs ViewModels to abstract both UI presentation logic and server interactions. For UI, ViewModels manage data presentation and UI-specific state, enabling components to remain focused on rendering. Similarly, `users.sm.ts` serves as a ViewModel for server interactions, abstracting the complexities of communicating with the backend and providing a reactive interface for data exchange between the server and the frontend.

### UI Components

UI components subscribe to data streams from the UI ViewModels, ensuring they render the most current data. User interactions are communicated back to the ViewModels, triggering updates that are then reactively reflected in the UI.

### Reactive Streams and Pure Functions

Thanks to the reactive stream approach adopted in this application, every piece of infrastructure is treated as a pure function. This design choice ensures that the system will never go out of sync, as the state is managed in a predictable and transparent manner. Reactive streams simplify handling complex data dependencies, making it easier to maintain and extend the application. The pure function architecture contributes to a robust and error-resistant system, where side effects are minimized, and data flow is clean and understandable. This approach not only enhances the reliability of the application but also improves the developer experience by providing a clear and logical structure for managing data and state changes.
